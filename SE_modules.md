# Sqeeuze and Excitation Networks

This file explains the implementation of Squeeze and Excitation modules in my ResNet50 Encoder Unet model in the TGS salt competition.

# What is it?

# How is it implemented?
The module is added to the model architecture after each convolutional block in general. 

If you wish to build your own algorithm or find other implementation of them, I cited them here:
