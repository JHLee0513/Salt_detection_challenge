# Salt_detection_challenge
Image Segmentation project based on Kaggle's TGS salt detection competition.

# Major ideas implemented in this project:
* Image segmentation model using U-net architecture UpSampling layers in Keras
* ResNet50 as encoder model of the segmentation model
* Image augmentation using opencv and numpy
* Test Time Augmentation (TTA) to predict stronger predictions
* Stratified K-Fold ensembling to develop a better-generalizing model
